# extenstionreade
This script is designed to read a directory for files that do not have a file extension and then rename the file with the appropriate file extenstion. 
The purpose of this script came from a retrun from a cloud provider who provided many files to an investigator with no way or reading them natively due to the lack of a file extension
. 
This script is ran via CLI and currently is only reading the headers of JPG files and PNG files and skips any others

In the future I am looking to add additional file headers to support videos and other file types. Please reachout if you would like something added.

If you're looking for more all encompassing script with a GUI, check out https://github.com/northloopforensics/AutoExtension from Northloop Forensics.
